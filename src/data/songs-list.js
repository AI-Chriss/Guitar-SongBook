          Am
        I met her in the summer
                       F
        Down by the Golden Bay
                        C
        Like flowers in the water
                        G
        I can't forget her face
          Am
        No wonder she's a stunner
                        F
        It takes my breath away
                        C
        Like flowers in the water
                       G
        She dances in the rain
        [Verse 1]
          Am
        There once was a boy that looked like me
         F
        And lived in a town right by the sea
          C                             G
        Just skipping stones and dreaming life away
          Am
        And that's no way for a boy to live
          F
        With the weather in mind and a heart so big
          C                               G
        Just waiting on a pretty girl to show her face
        [Chorus]
          Am
        I met her in the summer
                       F
        Down by the Golden Bay
                        C
        Like flowers in the water
                        G
        I can't forget her face
          Am
        No wonder she's a stunner
                        F
        It takes my breath away
                        C
        Like flowers in the water
                       G
        She dances in the rain
        Am F C G
          Am
        No wonder she's a stunner

                        C
        Like flowers in the water
                       G
        She dances in the rain
        [Verse 2]
          Am
        We'd sneak down by the roaring rocks
         F
        Her emerald eyes and fiery locks
         C                                G
        The greatest sight that I have ever seen
          Am
        She's a bonnie siren of the sea
         F
        And plays me like a melody
          C                                G
        Just blurring lines between real life and dreams
        [Chorus]
          Am
        I met her in the summer
                       F

        Like flowers in the water
                       G
        She dances in the rain
        [Bridge]
          Am                  C                   G
        Just like the waves I wish that she'd come back around
          Am                C            G
        And stay with me in this old town
        [Chorus]

                          Am
                        I met her in the summer

                        Down by the Golden Bay

                        There once was a boy that looked like me
                         F
                        And lived in a town right by the sea

                        It takes my breath away

                        There once was a boy that looked like me
                         F
                        And lived in a town right by the sea
                          C                             G
                        Just skipping stones and dreaming life away
                          Am
                        And that's no way for a boy to live
                          F
                        With the weather in mind and a heart so big
                          C                               G
                        Just waiting on a pretty girl to show her face

                        We'd sneak down by the roaring rocks
                         F
                        Her emerald eyes and fiery locks

                          Am
                        She's a bonnie siren of the sea

                        And plays me like a melody

                        Just blurring lines between real life and dreams
